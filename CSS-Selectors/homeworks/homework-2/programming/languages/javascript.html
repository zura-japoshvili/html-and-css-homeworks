        JavaScript is used to manage the behavior of web pages. With it, coders
        can create dynamic web elements such as animated graphics, interactive
        maps, clickable buttons and more. Programmers who use HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript in tandem obtain a higher level of website control and can
        provide a better user experience in terms of navigation and readability.
        JavaScript is the most common coding language in use today around the
        world. This is for a good reason: most web browsers utilize it and it’s
        one of the easiest languages to learn. JavaScript requires almost no
        prior coding knowledge — once you start learning, you can practice and
        play with it immediately. Moreover, because the language is so
        ubiquitous, there are countless communities, courses and avenues of
        professional support available online. This support, in addition to the
        language’s top-notch usability, makes JavaScript number one on our list
        of the most in-demand programming languages.

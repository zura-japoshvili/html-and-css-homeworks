      <p>
        Computer systems engineers are responsible for identifying solutions to
        complex applications problems, systems administration issues or network
        concerns. They work closely with clients or internal stakeholders to
        understand system needs and collaborate with developers to determine
        appropriate solutions. This is another programming career that is ideal
        for business-savvy professionals.

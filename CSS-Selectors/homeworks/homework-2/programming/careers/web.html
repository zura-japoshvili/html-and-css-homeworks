        How a website looks and functions is the direct result of a web
        developer’s work. All programming careers take patience, but this one
        provides more instant gratification than most. Web developers listen
        well to their clients’ needs and problem-solve to give them the best
        website possible for their business. At the end of a project, you have a
        working, accessible website to show off your hard work. Web developers
        do well when they can show a portfolio of their work and have a deep
        understanding of coding.

      <p>
        Software developers are responsible for creating and enhancing
        applications for cell phones, tablets and other mobile devices. This is
        an ideal programming career for someone who has a “big picture”
        mentality and likes to collaborate with others to bring ideas to life.
        Knowing coding basics and having an aptitude for math are also
        important.

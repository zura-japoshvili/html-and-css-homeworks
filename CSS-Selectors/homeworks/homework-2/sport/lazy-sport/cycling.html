      If you live in a medium-sized city or directly in a small town in the
      countryside, a good option is to start cycling. Whether it's to go to work
      (if it's not too far away) or to take a spin on the weekend, cycling is
      always a good option to move and have a good time without getting too
      tired. Nonetheless, if you live in a hilly place, maybe cycling is not the
      best option as you would have to use a lot of energy.

      In October 1886, Scotsman David Danskin and fifteen fellow munitions
      workers in Woolwich formed Dial Square Football Club, named after a
      workshop at the heart of the Royal Arsenal complex. Each member
      contributed sixpence and Danskin also added three shillings to help form
      the club.[4][a] Dial Square played their first match on 11 December 1886
      against Eastern Wanderers and won 6–0.[19] The club renamed to Royal
      Arsenal a month later,[18][20] and its first home was Plumstead
      Common,[18] though they spent most of their time playing at the Manor
      Ground. Their first trophies were the Kent Senior Cup and London Charity
      Cup in 1889–90 and the London Senior Cup in 1890–91; these were the only
      county association trophies Arsenal won during their time in South East
      London.[21][22] In 1891, Royal Arsenal became the first London club to
      turn professional.[23] Royal Arsenal renamed for a second time upon
      becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new
      name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended
      later that year.[24][25]: 5–21  Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern
      member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and
      reaching the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial
      difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more
      accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to
      bankruptcy by 1910.[26][25]: 112–149  Businessmen Henry Norris and William
      Hall became involved in the club, and sought to move them
      elsewhere.[27][25]: 22–42  In 1913, soon after relegation back to the
      Second Division, the grandstand of Woolwich Arsenal's Plumstead stadium
      was burnt down by the suffragettes, as part of their nationwide bombing
      and arson campaign for women's suffrage.[28][29] The attack cost £1,000 in
      damages (around £120,000 today), and so the same year the club moved
      across the river to the new Arsenal Stadium in Highbury.[28][30][31] In
      1919, The Football League controversially voted to promote The Arsenal,
      instead of relegated local rivals Tottenham Hotspur, into the newly
      enlarged First Division, despite only finishing fifth in the Second
      Division's last pre-war season of 1914–15. Later that year, The Arsenal
      started dropping "The" in official documents, gradually shifting its name
      for the final time towards Arsenal, as it is generally known today.[32]

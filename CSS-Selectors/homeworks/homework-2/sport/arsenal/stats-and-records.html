      Arsenal's tally of 13 League Championships is the third highest in English
      football, after Manchester United (20) and Liverpool (19),[204] and they
      were the first club to reach a seventh and an eighth League Championship.
      As of June 2020, they are one of seven teams, the others being Manchester
      United, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea, Manchester City, Leicester City and
      Liverpool, to have won the Premier League since its formation in
      1992.[205] They hold the highest number of FA Cup trophies, with 14.[206]
      The club is one of only six clubs to have won the FA Cup twice in
      succession, in 2002 and 2003, and 2014 and 2015.[207] Arsenal have
      achieved three League and FA Cup "Doubles" (in 1971, 1998 and 2002), a
      feat only previously achieved by Manchester United (in 1994, 1996 and
      1999).[77][208] They were the first side in English football to complete
      the FA Cup and League Cup double, in 1993.[209] Arsenal were also the
      first London club to reach the final of the UEFA Champions League, in
      2006, losing the final 2–1 to Barcelona.[210] Arsenal have one of the best
      top-flight records in history, having finished below fourteenth only seven
      times. They have won the second most top flight league matches in English
      football, and have also accumulated the second most points,[7] whether
      calculated by two points per win[7] or by the contemporary points
      value.[211] They have been in the top flight for the most consecutive
      seasons (95 as of 2020–21).[6][212][213] Arsenal also have the highest
      average league finishing position for the 20th century, with an average
      league placement of 8.5.[8] Arsenal hold the record for the longest run of
      unbeaten League matches (49 between May 2003 and October 2004).[76] This
      included all 38 matches of their title-winning 2003–04 season, when
      Arsenal became only the second club to finish a top-flight campaign
      unbeaten, after Preston North End (who played only 22 matches) in
      1888–89.[75][12] They also hold the record for the longest top flight win
      streak.[214] Arsenal set a Champions League record during the 2005–06
      season by going ten matches without conceding a goal, beating the previous
      best of seven set by A.C. Milan. They went a record total stretch of 995
      minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in the final,
      when Samuel Eto'o scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.[78] David
      O'Leary holds the record for Arsenal appearances, having played 722
      first-team matches between 1975 and 1993. Fellow centre half and former
      captain Tony Adams comes second, having played 669 times. The record for a
      goalkeeper is held by David Seaman, with 564 appearances.[215] Thierry
      Henry is the club's top goalscorer with 228 goals in all competitions
      between 1999 and 2012,[203] having surpassed Ian Wright's total of 185 in
      October 2005.[216] Wright's record had stood since September 1997, when he
      overtook the longstanding total of 178 goals set by winger Cliff Bastin in
      1939.[217] Henry also holds the club record for goals scored in the
      League, with 175,[203] a record that had been held by Bastin until
      February 2006.[218] Arsenal's record home attendance is 73,707, for a UEFA
      Champions League match against RC Lens on 25 November 1998 at Wembley
      Stadium, where the club formerly played home European matches because of
      the limits on Highbury's capacity. The record attendance for an Arsenal
      match at Highbury is 73,295, for a 0–0 draw against Sunderland on 9 March
      1935,[215] while that at Emirates Stadium is 60,161, for a 2–2 draw with
      Manchester United on 3 November 2007.

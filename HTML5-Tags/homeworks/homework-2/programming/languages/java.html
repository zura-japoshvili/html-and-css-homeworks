        Java is a general use and object-oriented programming language. In
        object-oriented programming, developers create objects that encompass
        functions and data, which can then be used to provide structure for
        programs and applications. Java currently ranks as the third-most
        sought-after programming language for hiring managers globally (PDF, 2.4
        MB) and has held the #5 spot on Stack Overflow’s list of the most
        commonly used languages for two years. Java’s popularity is for good
        reason; this language is relatively easy to learn and use, boasts
        incredible security and can handle massive amounts of data. These
        features make Java an ideal language for the online finance sector, and
        it is often applied in industries such as banking, billing and the stock
        market. The versatility of the language, however, is what learners find
        really appealing. Touted as a “write-once, run-anywhere” language, Java
        can effectively run on any operating system, regardless of which OS was
        used to write the original code. It is thus ideal for writing apps not
        only for mobile phones and computers, but also remote processors,
        sensors and a variety of other consumer products.

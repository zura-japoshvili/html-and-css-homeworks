        Python is a general-purpose programming language that empowers
        developers to use several different programming styles (i.e.,
        functional, object-oriented, reflective, etc.) when creating programs.
        Several popular digital tools and platforms were developed with Python,
        including YouTube, Google Search and iRobot machines. It is also,
        according to HackerRank, the second-most in-demand programming language
        for hiring managers in the Americas after Python (PDF, 2.4 MB). As one
        of the more easy-to-learn and -use languages, Python is ideal for
        beginners and experienced coders alike. The language comes with an
        extensive library that supports common commands and tasks. Its
        interactive qualities allow programmers to test code as they go,
        reducing the amount of time wasted on creating and testing long sections
        of code. That said, even advanced users would benefit from adding Python
        to their mental catalog of programming languages; with over 50% of
        hiring managers (PDF, 2.4MB) seeking candidates who know the language,
        Python is easily one of the most marketable and in-demand programming
        languages of 2022.
